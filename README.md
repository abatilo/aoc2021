# advent of copilot 2021

This repository is an attempt to solve the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) for 2021 using exclusively [copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) from GitHub.

At the time of writing, there's no way to cycle through the suggestions with
the vim plugin. Whatever copilot suggests is what I have to try to use or I
have to change the comment to get new code.

Rules of my challenge:
1. I am NOT allowed to modify any code that copilot generates
2. If I want different code, I have to change the comment
3. I am not allowed to write ANY of the Go code used. I'm only allowed to write comments. vim-go will do imports for me
